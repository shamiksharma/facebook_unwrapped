This program demonstrates how to build a Facebook Canvas Iframe app
using ONLY standard Python 2.6+. It does not use any Facebook wrappers.

The goal of this app is to make it easier for a new developer 
to understand how Facebook Oauth works. While FB wrapper libraries
make it easier to use Facebook API they also hide important
details, which hinders understanding. 

More details about how to run this app is documented inside the code.
